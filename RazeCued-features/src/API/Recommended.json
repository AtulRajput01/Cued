        "description": "When the stage is set, when spirits are ablaze, when laughter spreads like wildfire, when hardwork takes the form of success, know that we are talking about MECCA. If we tell you, it is not just a fest rather it is the celebration of every Hinduite as a team, we won't be wrong in our choice of words. If we tell you that the grandeur of MECCA is way too high for a college fest, we would be the one to bring out reality. When duos like Kings of chartbusters, Vishal-Shekhar and Merchants of sufi music, Salim-Sulaiman hit the beat, you ought to groove. A fest with a crowd of 70,000+ is something that made history. A stage that is witnessed by such a huge crowd , "
